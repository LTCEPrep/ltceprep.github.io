            	<p style="margin: 0em;">A major part of the LTC written exam covers medical terminology and procedures.&nbsp;  Fittingly, a major part of the LTCE Prep course covers medical vocabulary.&nbsp;  Given the galatic volume of medical terminology in existence, a judicious choice is made to limit the vocabulary of the course to that provided in the state of <a class="link-red" href="https://www.dshs.wa.gov/fsa/language-testing-and-certification-program/study-materials">Washington’s DSHS Language Testing & Certification Exam study booklet for the medical interpreters exam</a>.&nbsp;  The booklet includes a list of about 800 terms—not an insignificant number.&nbsp;  Of these, the LTCE Prep course directly covers 500, more or less, or a bit under two-thirds.&nbsp; This amount is subdivided into 8 primary vocabulary lists.&nbsp; Each of these 8 is thematically tied to a system of the body.&nbsp; Vis-à-vis the remaining 300 or so terms, they are subdivided into two additional lists.&nbsp; The first of these is a "Words You Should Know Already" list, or WYSKA for short.&nbsp; The second of these is the "Additional Words" list, which comprises the words not covered in the course but nonetheless should be studied for the exam.&nbsp; See below for more information on all of these lists.</p>

				<h2>Body System Lists</h2>
				<p>A core set of vocabulary is found on <a href="bodysystems.html" class="link-red"><strong>a series of 8 thematic body system vocabulary lists</strong></a>.&nbsp;  Each of these lists covers a system or two of the human body (such as the cardiovascular system, endocrine system, and reproductive system).&nbsp;  The accompanying terms relate in some manner to the specified body system, such as <em>a part of the body</em>, <em>an illness or disease</em>, <em>a method of treatment</em>, <em>a symptom</em>, <em>a related medication</em>, and so on.&nbsp;  These lists ought to be studied carefully, as they make up roughly two-thirds of the terms under consideration.</p>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> An acknowledgement is hereby made that some terms could easily be found on any number of the lists, and should not be considered as being list specific.  Additionally, some terms are shoehorned onto a list so as to balance out the number of terms across lists—approximately 65 terms per list.</p>

				<h2>WYSKA List</h2>
				<p>A number of terms found on the vocabulary list included in the LTC Exam study booklet are those that should already be known by a candidate (i.e., test taker).&nbsp; These terms have been turned into a <a href="wyska.html" class="link-red"><strong>"Words You Should Know Already"</strong></a> list, or WYSKA (pronounced 'HWIS-k<em>uh</em>') for short.&nbsp; Almost all of these terms fall in or below the K-4 word list in the English language.&nbsp; That is, these words are of the four thousand most commonly used words in English, and thereby should already be in a candidate's word bank.&nbsp; Accordingly, the course will devote no time studying these terms.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the list should be reviewed to check if any terms are unfamiliar.</p>

				<h2>Additional Words</h2>
				<p>A number of terms are found neither on any of the body system lists nor on the WYKSA list.&nbsp;  These make up the <a href="awl.html" class="link-red"><strong>"Additional Words"</strong></a> list.&nbsp;  There are around 150 terms on this list, terms that may or may not be all that familiar.&nbsp;  As such, each ought to be reviewed closely, being certain that both their meaning is understood and an equivalent term in a target language is known.</p>
