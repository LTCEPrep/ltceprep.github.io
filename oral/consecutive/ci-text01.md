<p class="CIE-Content" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Two years ago, I developed a spasm in my left pinky that would come and go.  When I was younger, I had minor muscle spasms whenever I was under stress.  But, the spams never lasted more than a week or two.</p>
<p class="CIE-Content" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">During the last six months, I started to have severe tremors in my left arm.  My arm just shakes.  I cannot control the tremors, either.  I took some medication to relax my muscles, but they pills don’t seem to be helping the problem. I am afraid that something more serious than stress is causing the tremors.</p>
<p class="CIE-Content" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Lately, my symptoms have multiplied.  I notice that I am having problems with my balance.  However, I don’t feel dizzy. In the morning, I struggle to get dressed.   Sometimes I cannot even button my shirt.  Also, I am often constipated.  I can go two days without a bowel movement.   The feeling is very uncomfortable.</p>
