<div class="CIE-Content-Header">Recording VI: Unknown Cause Symptoms</div> 		
<div id="changeFontColor">
<p class="CIE-Content">For the past two years, I have had a lot of pain in my joints.  The aching has come and gone, but the discomfort seems to be more constant.  Mostly the pain is in my fingers, but I have some pain in other joints also.  I had some tests run for Lyme’s disease, but the test results came back negative.  I am not sure if the pain contributes to my exhaustion or is just another symptom.</p>
<p class="CIE-Content">I’ve been having problems with my bladder, too.  I wake up several times during the night to go to the bathroom.  Because of my bladder problem, I cannot get enough sleep.  In the past couple of years, I have had several urinary tract infections.  Oh, I should mention that diabetes does run in my family.</p>
<p class="CIE-Content">Sometimes I feel terrible nausea for several days.  However, when I feel that I am going to vomit, I never do.  I have dealt with this problem before when I was in my early 20s.  But, the problem eventually went away.  At the time, the doctors said my nausea was probably due to stress.  I just recently started taking anti-depressants, so those may be the cause of my nausea.</p>
