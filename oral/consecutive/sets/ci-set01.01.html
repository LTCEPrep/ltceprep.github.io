<h3>Dialog 01</h3>
<p><strong>Doctor:</strong>	Good morning Mr. Jones.  What is wrong?</p>
<p><strong>Mr Jones</strong> Good morning, Doctor, Williams.  I feel very ill.  /   I am coughing and sneezing.  I feel hot and cold all the time.   /   Whenever I eat, I feel nauseous, like I am going to vomit.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor:</strong>	Let me take your temperature.   /   How long have you had the symptoms?</p>
<p><strong>Mr Jones</strong>	My symptoms started about a day ago.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor:</strong>	Yes, your temperature is very high.  I think you have the flu.     /    You will have to go home and stay in bed until you feel better.   /   Drink lots of water so you will not become dehydrated.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Jones</strong>	Can you give me some medicine?</p>
<p><strong>Doctor:</strong>	I can give you something to reduce your fever   /   but you just need to get bed rest.     /   I will write you a prescription.  What pharmacy do you use?</p>
<p><strong>Mr Jones</strong>	I use Safeway pharmacy, on the corner of Hamilton and Mission.  Thank you, doctor.</p>
