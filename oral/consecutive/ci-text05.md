<p class="CIE-Content" style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">In December, I started having horrible cramps in my abdomen.  Around the same time, I began to have episodes of diarrhea.  I went to a doctor to have things checked out.  She wrote me a prescription for my camps, and said that stress perhaps was causing the diarrhea.</p>
<p class="CIE-Content" style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">The medicine did not help, so I went back to see the doctor.  She put me on a new mediation. She thought my symptoms might be due to a bacterial infection.  She ran some blood work, but the test results came back negative.</p>
<p class="CIE-Content" style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">A few weeks later, I had to go to the emergency room due to dehydration. My diarrhea had become uncontrollable.  The doctor suspected that I had colitis and ordered some blood work.  I also had a CT scan.  The result of both came back positive.  He recommended that I make an appointment to see you, doctor. </p>
