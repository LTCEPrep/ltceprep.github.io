<h2>Consecutive Interpretation</h2>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> This exercise has pre-recorded audio materials.   Press the <span style="color: red;">[Play Audio]</span> button and provide a consecutive interpretation of the recording from English into your target language.  The recorded materials have built-in pauses. These pauses allow you adequate time to render the interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>Note for non-certified languages:</strong> On the state of Washington's LTC Exam, you will only be translating from your target language into English.  Nevertheless, these exercises will provide you practice listening to an audio recording and translating it into another language. </p>
