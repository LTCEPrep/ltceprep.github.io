<p class="CIE-Content" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">My son has not been feeling well for a couple of weeks, now.  He had food poisoning twice, but he refused to go see a doctor.  I think he lost at least 5 pounds, maybe 10.  He limited his diet to just liquids and crackers. </p>
<p class="CIE-Content" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">This morning, he woke up with a severe headache.  He complained that he had very stiff neck and could not turn his head.  He took several Ibuprofen tablets, but the medicine did not help.  By the afternoon, he started to run a high fever.</p>
<p class="CIE-Content" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Around 7:00 oâ€™clock, he said he had a sharp pain in his left ear.  He wanted to lie down and sleep, but I was afraid to let him do so.  He grew confused and struggled to speak.  He had a strange pallor.  That is when I got scared.</p>
