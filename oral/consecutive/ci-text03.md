<p class="CIE-Content" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I used to run about 5 times a week.  However, one day last month, I felt really weak after I exercised. I could not breathe properly and just felt as though I were going to die.   My breathing was very rapid but shallow.  As I tried to breath in deep, I heard a loud wheezing sound.</p>
<p class="CIE-Content" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">The feeling was gone by the next day.  However, I was coughing up really thick, white phlegm.  And when I lay down, I had some shortness of breath.  I started to cough, and felt a general pain in my chest area.  I checked my pulse.  My heart rate was higher than normal.</p>
<p class="CIE-Content" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I have started to notice some swelling in the lower part of my body. I still have swelling in my feet and ankles especially.  When I push on the swollen area with my finger for five seconds, a dimple remains.  I cannot figure it out.  I have not started any new medications.   What is happening to me?</p>
